        <p>There are mutliple ways to navigate NEII Viewer's map view. Use whichever method you prefer.
        <i>Hint: Mouse over the <b>Compass Control</b> (see image below) to see help on its use.</i></p>

              <p>Move your <b>mouse pointer</b> over the map and use the <b>scroll wheel</b> to zoom in or out. The location at the
              centre of the map display is the centre of the zooming.</p>
              
              <p><b>Right-click</b> and <b>drag</b> upwards or downwards over the map to zoom about the centre point. (Dragging left or right has no effect.)

              <b>Command + R</b> on Mac OS will reload the entire NEII Viewer web page. This will result in a reset which will show the whole of Australia,
              but it also results in the total loss of all your context information from the current session, which includes display information
              and selected Data Sets. It is not recommended unless you are experiencing problems.)</i></p>

            <td>
              <p>Use the <strong>Compass Control</strong> (see image below) to rotate the map so North is no longer at the top. Click on the "gyroscope"
              in the centre
              of the <strong>Compass Control</strong> and drag slowly to the left or right to rotate the map clockwise or anti-clockwise respectively.
              The further you drag, the faster it rotates. Release the mouse button when you reach the desired rotation.</p>
                         
              <p>Click on the North Point or outer ring of the <b>Compass Conrol</b> (see image below)
              and drag it around to set the desired rotation directly.</p>
              
              <p><b>Control + left-click</b> and <b>drag</b> left or right over the map to rotate the view about the centre. (On Windows
              systems you can also use <b>Middle-click</b> and <b>drag</b>.)</p>

            <td>
              <p>Click on the "gyroscope" in the centre of the <strong>Compass Control</strong> (see image below) and drag slowly upwards
              to tilt the view into a Perspective View. Drag downwards
              to tilt the view back to vertical. The further you drag, the faster it tilts. Release the mouse button when you reach the
              desired view.</p>
              
              <p><b>Control + left-click</b> and <b>drag</b> upwards or downwards over the map
              to enter or adjust the perspective view. (On Windows
              systems you can also use <b>Middle-click</b> and <b>drag</b>.)</p>
              
              <p>When you are in Perspective View, <b>Control + left-click</b> and <b>drag</b> left or right over the map
              to "orbit" around the centre of the view. You can also click and drag left or right over the "gyroscope" at the centre
              of the <b>Compass Control</b> to orbit about the centre of the view.</p>
              
              <p><b>Double-click</b> the "gyroscope" in the centre of the <b>Compass Control</b> to return the view quickly to a vertical view with
              North to the top at the current location and scale.</p>
                                    
              <p>Dragging to Pan and using the Mouse Wheel to zoom still work while showing a Perspective View.</p>
              
              <p>Even the topography and road maps can be viewed in perspective.</p>
              
              <p>You can't simulate looking from under the ground because the system always keeps the "camera position" above the earth's surface,
              but you can create a view which is looking only at the sky. Tilt back downwards to recover.</p>
              
              <p><i>Hint: In Australia, Cradle Mountain and Katoomba are good places to use for experimenting with Perspective View.
              Use the <a href="SearchTab.html">Search Tab</a>
              to locate them. (Other very high relief areas like the Grand Canyon or Mount Everest - not the ones in NSW - are also really cool!)</i></p>

                   <li>Select <strong>3D Terrain</strong> to show a Perspective View which shows the elevation changes in the terrain.
                   <strong>3D Smooth</strong> and
                   <strong>3D Terrain</strong> will look almost the same unless you are using Perspective View. <i>Note: <b>3D Terrain</b> view
                   may give the same result as <b>3D Smooth</b> or may not work at all on some computers with older graphic cards or older web browser versions.</i></li>
                   <li>Click on one of the Base map thumbnails to select the type of map to view. Mouse over the thumbnails to see a hint on what they are.
                      (<strong>NASA Black Marble</strong>, <strong>Australian Hydrography</strong> and <strong>Natural Earth II</strong> may show as
                      completely one colour if you are zoomed in too far. Try these ones on a zoomed out view first.)</li>
