It registers the spatial relationships between important hydrological features such as rivers, water bodies, aquifers and monitoring points.\n\nBy detailing the spatial dimensions of these hydrofeatures and how they are connected, it is possible to analyse how water is stored, transported and used through the landscape.</p><p>The quality of the spatial data and attribution is largely based upon the input data from AusHydro and ANUDEM Streams and the National Catchment Boundaries. Additional post-processing of these feature classes creates the resulting feature classes within the Geofabric products.",
