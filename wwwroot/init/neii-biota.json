Some non-NVIS data have been used in the development of these products where gaps exist in the NVIS spatial data.\nThese broader-scale interpretations are limited to 33 MVGs and 85 MVSs that represent the dominant vegetation in each spatial feature. (Note: the exact number of Groups and Subgroups varies between some NVIS versions.)\nThese products are designed for broad use at a national or state-wide scale or for simple vegetation descriptions at a regional scale. They are available in Present (Extant) and Estimated Pre-1750 (pre-European) vegetation themes.",
