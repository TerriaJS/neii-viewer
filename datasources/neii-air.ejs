The framework uses a maturity model approach outlining the various degrees of conformity.</p><p>Specific principles in the framework include the following:</p><ul><li>Environmental data are made publically available through machine-readable web data services (published online).</li><li>Structured metadata will support any NEII data release (well described).</li><li>Providers will make their data available through under an open licence.</li><li>Data are provided with support structures that provide enduring operational support to users.</li></ul><p>The first principle is mandatory and in the absence of the availability of environmental data through web data services, NEII conformance is not possible at any level of maturity.</p><p>See the <a href="http://www.neii.gov.au/system/files/filedepot/1/NEII%20Conformance%20Framework%20Version%201.0%20May%202016.pdf" target="_blank">NEII Conformance Framework</a> for a detailed overview of what constitutes conformance.</p><p>See <a href="http://www.neii.gov.au/web-data-services" target="_blank">here</a> for a list of NEII conformant web data services and how to access.</p>",
