National Map
============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NICTA/nationalmap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NICTA/nationalmap)

The [National Map](http://nationalmap.gov.au) is a website for map-based access to Australian spatial data from government agencies. It is an initiative of the Australian Commonwealth Government's [Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet](http://www.dpmc.gov.au/) and the software has been developed by [NICTA](http://www.nicta.com.au/) working closely with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, [Geoscience Australia](http://www.ga.gov.au/) and other government agencies.

The National Map is designed to:
* Provide easy access to authoritative and other spatial data to government, business and public
* Facilitate the opening of data by federal, state and local government bodies
* Provide an open framework of geospatial data services that supports commercial and community innovation
